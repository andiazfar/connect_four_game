# Connect Four Game created by using jQuery

To start, enter your name and your partner's name.
You win when you can stack 4 of your colors in any direction.

This is a simple Connect Four game I created by using jQuery.
To fully understand this code, you will need understanding of a few things:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. DOM Manipulation
5. Bootstrap (Because I use it in my HTML. You should be able to recreate something like this without using Bootstrap.)
